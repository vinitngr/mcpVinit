Concept: Running MCP Servers using Different Commands

We explored two ways to configure and run our MCP servers:

1. Using NPX:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vinit-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["vinit-mcp"]
    }
  }
}

- This approach uses `npx` to run the CLI directly if it's published on npm or linked globally.
- It helps avoid hardcoding the path to the script.
- Suitable when the CLI is installed globally or available in your npm registry.

2. Using Node and Direct File Path:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vinit-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\HP VICTUS\\Desktop\\PROJECTMCP\\dist\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}

- This method executes the compiled JavaScript file directly using Node.
- Useful for local development or when the script is not published globally.
- Requires the absolute path to the file, which can be less flexible.

Summary:
- Use `npx` when working with published or globally linked CLIs.
- Use `node` with a file path for local scripts still in development.
- Both approaches give flexibility depending on whether your CLI is local or shared.
