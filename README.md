# MCP Server

This repository contains a basic implementation of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It features a server-side connection setup with lightweight and minimal tooling for running basic MCP functionality. The code is intended for practice and experimentation, with simple tools integrated for interaction with the MCP. No complex tooling or advanced features are included‚Äîjust the essentials for getting started with MCP protocol integration.

## MCP Server Configuration

This section outlines the configuration for the MCP server setup in different configuration files (`vscode_mcp`, `claude_desktop_config.json`, and `mcp_config.json`). 

These configuration files allow you to set up and run the MCP server using the `node` command and specify the arguments needed for the correct execution of your project.
